# Distributed LDA with gensim

Unsupported and unofficial example of distributing gensim's LDA, per the [Distributed Computing](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/distributed.html) docs, using the [CDSW Workers API](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdsw/1.9.1/parallel-computing/topics/cdsw-workers-api.html).
This is a toy example to illustrate the wiring, and not representative of real workloads.
